    "# Pass by reference\n",
    "\n",
    "As you start writing larger programs, there is an important detail about the inner workings of Python (and many other programming languages), that should also be studied. The concept is called *pass by reference*, and it can be the source of a lot of bugs for intermediate level programmers who don't understand it well enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core concept is that simple variables, so floats, integers, booleans, are treated differently than complex variables like lists, dictionaries and tuples. These simple variables are called the *primitive types*, while variables that can actually store multiple variables together are called *complex types*.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've just covered classes, it might be good to know that all complex types are actually just objects. So, when you write `some_list.append(elem)`, you're calling the `append()` method on an instance of the list class. Or, when you write `some_array.shape`, you're accessing the `shape` attribute on an instance of the ndarray class. The difference here is that these objects are built-in in Python or Numpy, while in the previous modules you defined your own objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex data types can contain massive amounts of data, depending on the application. In some cases, this might be a Numpy array containing a very large data set with millions of entries, or it might be list itself containing other lists, and so on. In the previous module you've also seen that objects can store many different attributes together, and some of those attributes might themselves also contain instances of other objects!\n",
    "\n",
    "As complex data types can contain these large amounts of data, they need to be handled differently in order for operations to remain efficient. All complex data types are therefore given their own space somewhere in the memory, where all this data is just stored *once*. If we need a function to work with this data, we can just refer to it using the memory address where the object was stored, which just a *reference* of where to find this data on the computer. This where the name *pass by reference* comes from.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with your own classes, you've probably even already seen these memory address reference pop up. Below is a quick example. If you run it, you'll see something like `<__main__.Test object at 0x...>`, where the `...` will actually be the memory address where the instance of the test object is stored on your computer."

    "This is a really hard example to predict correctly, but this is shows exactly why you never want to modify a list *while also looping over that same list*. By removing elements from the list, the indices of the list get updated, meaning the loop index will no longer point to the correct element, causing some elements in the list to get skipped by the loop. Note that appending things to the list will also extend your loop, and so appending while looping could also cause infinite loops.\n",

    "This example also is exactly why you had to use a separate list in the previous assignment when removing creatures that had died from list of creatures. If you would have removed then from the same list you're looping over, certain dead creatures would not have been removed correctly, because they would have been skipped in the loop.\n",

    "## References in your own assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "When working on the next few assignments, try to keep these few examples in back of your mind. So, when passing variables to functions, ask yourself if this is a complex type with a reference, or just a primitive type. Then, consider if this function might change that reference, and if that would cause a problem in your case, or not. Finally, if changing the original might cause a problem, consider if you just need a shallow copy, or full deep copy of all the inner reference is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trade-off here is efficiency. If your function does not modify the input, or the input can just be modified without problem, then passing the reference is *much* more efficient. A deep copy will never encounter any pass-by-reference issues, but this can be a very expensive operation to do every time you call a function on a large data set. The import takeaway is to know these problems can arise, and to consider if a copy is really needed.\n",
