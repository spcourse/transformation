## Pass by reference

This will be a quick demo notebook covering an important new topic in programming, namely pass by reference.

Download the notebook [here](data/pass_by_reference.ipynb).

There are only open questions in the notebook, but make sure to still save the version with your answers, as you'll need to submit this at the end of the module.
